                    <p class="txt">Heat transfer is having importance in many different areas, for example, solar application, 
                        waste heat recovery, electronic cooling in computer, and all other electronic components which generate
                         heat. Generation of heat takes place in many applications and this heat must be transferred or removed from 
                         the immediate environment and ejected in some suitable heat sink. Therefore, it is necessary to find more efficient 
                         method of removing heat from source to sink. Heat pipe is one of such promising technology which can be used to 
                         transfer large amount of energy over a small temperature gradient because of large latent heat transfer associated 
                         with the phase change processes. Their simple design, cost effectiveness, high efficiency, good compactness, 
                         reliability and durability have made them very attractive for many industrial applications like waste heat 
                         recovery, heating ventilation and air conditioning, electronic cooling, human body temperature control, 
                         cooling of gas turbine rotor blades, solar energy etc. It is used to improve the thermal performance of 
                         heat exchanger and with increasing energy saving application with commercial use.

                        it can be of any shapes as per the application) made of a material that is compatible with the working 
                        fluid. Such examples are aluminium is used as a material when ammonia is used as a working fluid or copper 
                        is used as a material when water is used as a working fluid. This container is divided in three parts along the length.</p>

                        or from the surrounding. In condenser section (heat sink), heat is rejected to the heat sink by 
                        the working medium so it will be converted into liquid. It is not necessary to have only one source 
                        or sink; it may have more than one source and sink as per the requirement of the application. 
                        The heat pipe is partially filled with a working fluid and then sealed. Once the filling is done, 
                        it is sealed. Mass of the working fluid is chosen in such a way that heat pipe contains both vapour

                    application in Design Modeller and mesh was generated. Near wall mesh was kept highly refined compared to the 
                    other mesh as to capture the minute changes occurring near the wall. The computational simulation is carried out 
                    to study two phase flow and heat transfer phenomena in the Heat Pipe by using FLUENT 16. The volume of fluid method 
                    is used to simulate the multiphase flow. Depending upon the use of Heat Pipe in some cases the body force term was 
                    included and, in some cases, it was neglected. The Body force term was considered by activating the acceleration due 
                    to gravity. A transient simulation with a variable time step which varies in the range of 0.0001 to 0.0005 sec is carried 
                    out to model the dynamic behaviour of the multiphase flow. The time step is selected based on the Courant number, 
                    is the ratio of the time step to time require for fluid to move across the cell. The numerical simulation is 
                    considered to be converged when the residuals for mass and velocity components are reduced to 10-6.</p>
